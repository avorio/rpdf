BUG: The functions "peaks" and "valleys" do not return the peak/valley if two consecutive bins at the peak/valley have the same value. 
Instead of not returning any value, I think it would be better to return the first/middle/last bin having the peak value.

FIXED --- faisal -- 22.11.2006
In case of consecutive bins having same values, last bin is returned. Wrote test cases in test-imgmisc.cc and added an example image where it crashed previously but now works fine.
