This is the Python binding for OCRopus through Lua, in an early stage.
The main feature is the conversion between narrays and numpy arrays.

So far the following methods are available in the `ocropus' module:

    eval(expression)            - evaluate the expression in the Lua interpreter
    get(name)                   - get a Lua global
    set                         - set a Lua global
    call(function, param_tuple) - invoke a Lua global function

Building:
    - Compile OCRopus (look in <ocropus release directory>/INSTALL and note the -fPIC options)
    - Run python setup.py build

You'll get an ocropus.so built somewhere in build/ hierarchy. This is the whole
OCRopus as a Python extension. Place it in a Python path and try importing it.
